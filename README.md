# Miscellaneous Utilities for Messing Around with Quests

*Disclaimer: mostly b0rken, all hacky*

## Heracles

- `clean_style.sh`	: throw-away script for "cleaning" some quest descriptions
- `dependsOn.sh`		: uses `jq` and `rg` to list dependent quests	
- `pqiac.py`				: Put Quests In A Circle

## FTB Quests

- `h2f.py`					: converts a group of Heracles quest files into a single FTBQ chapter .snbt file.
